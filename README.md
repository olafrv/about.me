# About this

This is a document to describe shortly my leadership style.

# About me

## Origin

I was raised as German in [Venezuela](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela), so I have in my heart the best of both worlds, the "made in germany" results spirit and "life is a carnival" joy for life. Feel free [join my network](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olafrv/). 

## Memory

I can [recall mostly everything than happen in my life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory) with a lot of details (e.g. faces, text on a page in specific books, emails threads, random chats, movies scripts, emotions), it is both a blessing and a curse. Don't get surprised if, I mention something good or bad from our past together, don't take it personally, past is important for improving the future (e.g. World War II).

## Storytelling

I like [storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling), most (introverts) techies don't. But is the only way to give people more context instead of harsh instructions like a paid assassin, since anyways after too many killings without sense people will start asking: why?, so I'm saving that time upfront. Sometimes I take shortcuts using [memes](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator) and leave the story behind it to people's mind.

## Passionate

I’m very passionate of what I do especially for others, I’m very responsive on chats and e-mails and ad-hoc meetings, but also like no crazy shit on Fridays so I can expend the weekend in peace with myself or my family.

## Coding

I was a full employed developer but still active most of the time in side projects, [here](https://github.com/olafrv) what I'm able to share without infringing copyrights of current and previous employers.

# About us

## Modesty

I'm humble leader than bossy person also mostly integrative under stressful situations, in the same line, I expect people to flawlessly work daily within the team while pulling others they need to accomplish their work.

## Common Sense

I appreciate [common sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense) ruling over any (over) engineering or (fancy) project dogmas, usually time will tell, but people always forget that [Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein) since ages is a tragic history.

## Self-Drive

I believe “it does not make sense to hire smart people and (most of the time) then tell what to do”, so for challenges we may face, I expect people to come with ideas to bounce for approval.

## Planning

I agree with: ["Plans are worthless, but planning is everything"](https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/eisenhowers/quotes).  I'm very much organised person, writing almost everything so I can be ready when (if) memory fails, prioritise the daily battle and share a link instead of having a time consuming rhetoric talk.

## Delegation

I exercise the [delegation poker](https://management30.com/practice/delegation-poker/) but when I see things burning or people request help, I will jump into their side, sometimes I will be insanely deep until exhaustion (i.e. root cause, next steps).

## The little things

I like very much attention to details as the little things always caught us (even if people currently don't mind about it). I believe most of the post-mortems (in life) happen because the little things are just ignored (many times in purpose or even with valid reasons). So tackling the little things can save people a lot of extra working hours (aka. life time).

## Operations

I know about all the Agile and cool Dev*Ops enterprise [parafhernalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphernalia) that is out there, but when it comes down to [ITOps](https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-operations) the final goal is to be near zero downtime, lowest complexity and keep things as secure as possible, so my arguments and decisions lean towards the lower risks options ([ITIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL)-alike).

## Legacy

I think of my work as the [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) I left to others, indeed anything people is doing right now is the legacy of tomorrow. So I expect the work people do is the best considering "who, what and where" is available at that time but also those whoever will deal with it afterwards (as much as possible).

## Meetings

(At work) I will try (regularly) to schedule them with people to discuss personal (if they don't mind →   I've nothing to hide), business or technical topics, if not feel free to book me anytime.
